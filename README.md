BASIC Interpreter: doubleII
This is a simple BASIC interpreter that allows you to write, execute, save, and load BASIC programs with support for variables, arithmetic operations, and basic input/output functionality.

Features:
Commands Supported:
LET for variable assignments with support for arithmetic expressions.
PRINT to display output.
INPUT for taking user input and storing it in variables.
RUN to execute the program.
LIST to list the current program.
SAVE to save the program to a file.
LOAD to load a program from a file.
EXIT to exit the interpreter.
Variable Support: Use variables in LET statements and PRINT commands.
Arithmetic Operations: Support for basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Persistent Storage: Save and load programs to/from files.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
pyfiglet (for program header)
termcolor (for colored terminal output)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyfiglet termcolor
Running the Interpreter:
Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone the repository or download the script file.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doubleII.git
cd doubleII
Run the Interpreter: To run the interpreter, simply execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python basic_interpreter.py
This will start the interpreter in the terminal.

Commands Overview:
LET Command
Assigns a value to a variable. You can use arithmetic operations in the assignment.

basic
Copy code
10 LET X = 5 + 3
20 LET Y = X * 2
PRINT Command
Prints output to the screen. You can print both strings and variables.

basic
Copy code
30 PRINT X
40 PRINT "Hello, World!"
INPUT Command
Prompts the user for input and stores the value in a variable.

basic
Copy code
50 INPUT "Enter your name: ", Name
60 PRINT "Hello, " + Name
RUN Command
Executes the program.

basic
Copy code
RUN
LIST Command
Lists all the lines of code in the current program.

basic
Copy code
LIST
SAVE Command
Saves the current program to a file. Specify the directory and filename.

basic
Copy code
SAVE "C:/path/to/program.txt"
LOAD Command
Loads a program from a file.

basic
Copy code
LOAD "C:/path/to/program.txt"
EXIT Command
Exits the interpreter.

basic
Copy code
EXIT
Example Program:
basic
Copy code
10 LET X = 5 + 3
20 LET Y = X * 2
30 PRINT X
40 PRINT Y
50 INPUT "What is your name? ", Name
60 PRINT "Hello, " + Name
70 END
Expected Output:
csharp
Copy code
8
16
What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice
Saving and Loading Programs:
To save your program, use the SAVE command followed by the path and filename. For example:
basic
Copy code
SAVE "C:/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/my_program.txt"
To load a program, use the LOAD command followed by the path to the file:
basic
Copy code
LOAD "C:/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/my_program.txt"
Notes:
The interpreter is very basic and does not support advanced features like arrays, loops, or conditional statements.
Arithmetic operations are evaluated using Python's built-in eval() function, so be cautious when working with user inputs or external data.
